# Benchmarks

The main idea is to run the existing HLS benchmarks to see if they work - they can only test correctness for a single set of input by a customised test bench.

- jacob_2d: a benchmark from Polybench
- sobel: a benchmark from LegUp HLS
- getTanh: a benchmark from DASS
- fft: a benchmark from MachSuite
- KMeans: a benchmark from Felix's work

Note all the benchmark set above (links included in the source code) should be all synthesisable, so you may be able to show coverage instead of a single benchmark.
